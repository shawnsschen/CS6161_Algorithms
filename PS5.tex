%	PROBLEM 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Problem 4}
First, we can call an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, as a subroutine to compute a min-cut according to the max-flow min-cut theorem. As per the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, its time complexity is $O(|V||E|^2)$. \\

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is actually to solve the directed graphs, but we can make our undirected graph directed by introducing two opposing directed edges on every undirected edge. This could essentially require $O(|V|^2)$ calls to the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. And some of the min-cut solutions could be equivalent for the original undirected graph. But effectively, this would not change the time bound that we will discuss later. \\

So we could repeatedly call Edmonds-Karp algorithm for each input $(s, t)$ and get a cut $C$ of volume $|C|$. Assume cut $C$ contains edge $e_1, e_2, ... , e_k$. For each $e_i: i \in [k]$, we increase the capacity of $e_i$ by a constant factor $\delta$, and call Edmonds-Karp again to get a new min-cut $C_i$ for it. When iterating over $e_i$, if there exists a $|C_i|=|C|$ and $C_i \neq C$, $C$ is not the unique min-cut. On the other hand, if there exists another min-cut $C'$ other than $C$, there also exists some $e_i \in C, e_i \notin C'$. Changing the capacity of that $e_i$ would not affect $C'$, which still leads to $|C|=|C_i|$. Thus, overall, the graph has a unique min-cut iff $|C| \textless |C_i|$ for all $i$. \\

To conclude, our algorithm is: \\
1. Turning undirected $G$ into a directed $G'$. \\
2. Enumerate all the possible $(s, t)$ in $G'$ and correspondingly call Edmonds-Karp algorithm. \\
3. After getting the cut $C$, iterate over all edges in $C$, increase capacity and call Edmonds-Karp. \\
4. See if $|C| \textless |C_i|$ for all $i$. If so, return $C$. \\

In the worst case, for each input $(s, t)$, we need to call Edmonds-Karp at most $|E|+1$ times to determine whether the first returned cut $C$ is unique or not. And for the undirected graph, we need to repeat $O(|V|^2)$ times. So eventually, this algorithm takes $O(|E|^3|V|^3)$, which is polynomial.

%	PROBLEM 5

\section*{Problem 5}
The algorithm is as follows: \\
1. Construct $G^3$ of graph $G = (V, E)$. \\
2. Compute the BST for $G^3$. \\
3. Take a full walk of the BST and log the first-time visited vertices sequentially in H. \\
4. return the Hamiltonian cycle H. \\

First, according to the definition of the 3rd power of graph G, $G^3 = (V, E^3)$ where there is an edge
$(u, v) \in E^3$ such that $\forall path_{uv} \in G$, it only contains at most 3 edges. In other words, if there exists an edge from u to v in $G^3$, the path from u to v in G would not exceed 3 edges. \\
Assume the costliest edge in the optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($H^*$) is $w^*$. Since the Halmitonian cycle is constructed by adding an edge to the BST, the costliest edge in the BST cannot exceed $w^*$. Because if the extra edge added into the BST is no heavier than $w^*$, the BST has the same cost as the cycle. Otherwise if the extra edge is heavier than $w^*$, the cycle has more cost than the BST. \\
Thus, in G, we have $c_{max}(BST^*) \leq c_{max}(H^*) = w^*$. \\
And also note that a full walk (W) of the BST satisfies $c_{max}(W) \leq 3w^* = 3c_{max}(H^*)$. Because by definition of $G^3$, the costliest edge in the walk can correspondingly map to a path in G with at most 3 edges. Even for the worst case, all 3 edges are equally costliest, which is $w^*$. The costliest edge in the walk will not exceed $3w^*$. \\
Finally, apply the triangle inequality, skipping nodes in the walk will not increase the cost, which leads to
$c_{max}(H) \leq c_{max}(W)$. \\
To sum it up, there is $c_{max}(H) \leq c_{max}(W) \leq 3c_{max}(H^*)$. \\
From above, we see that this algorithm gives an approximation ratio of 3. \\

Now consider the time complexity, for a graph with $|V|$ vertices, there could exist at most $\frac{|V|*(|V|-1)}{2}$ edges. Thus, constructing $G^3$ can be done within polynomial time $O(|V|^2)$. \\
And from problem 23-3, we can compute the BST by removing edges starting from the costliest in linear time. Taking a full walk can also easily be done in polynomial time. So overall, this algorithm is polynomial.
